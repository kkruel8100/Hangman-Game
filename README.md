# Hangman-Game

### The app is a Pizza Hangman Game.  The app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML powered by the JavaScript code.

#### How the app works:

1. Press play to start.
2. If the word is spinach, it is displayed like this when the game starts: _ _ _ _ _ _ _. 
3. The objective of the game is to guess all the letters in the word before 6 wrong guesses are used up.
4. If the player guesses incorrectly 6 times, they are dead and the game is over.
	- Letters guessed are listed on the screen.
	- The player is not penalized for guessing the same letter more than once.
	- If the player guesses the word correctly, applause is generated and the player can play again.
	- If the player dies, the death march sounds.
5. On the left side of the screen, the rules for the game are listed.
6. Under the rules, the number of wins and losses are calculated. If the player wishes to reset the win/loss record, they can click on the reset button.
